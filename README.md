# tslint-rules

Custom rules for TSLint.

## Install

Clone repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/pe8ter/tslint-rules).

Install dependencies and build:

```shell
$ npm i
$ npm run build
```

The build output is in the `dist` directory. Follow the [directions from the TSLint page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tslint#custom-rules) to use the custom rules in your project.

The notice at the top of the TypeScript files to not edit them is for the built JavaScript, not the source files
themselves.
